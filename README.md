# Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-NLP-Practice-Notebooks

In general, there are three steps required for better skill acquisition:
1. Knowledge
2. Accumulative Experience
3. Practice

Firstly, knowledge is related to the theoretical part, or in other words the science behind the skill. Secondly, Accumulative Experience is developed by the different experiences you have in what you learned before since you might link new things in a different way based on your previous experiences.

Finally, practice is about applying the knowledge you acquired while exploiting your previous accumulative experience.

Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing "NLP" are also skills that if I want to better acquire, I have to do all three steps for skill acquisition.

Therefore guided by other practitioners, and Notebooks in this field, implementing them with myself while trying to analyze why they took each step and the different relations between different steps will help me become a better Machine Learning and NLP engineer.

In this repository I will upload different notebooks I implemented with myself after finishing them, and I will mention the reference from which I have got these Notebooks.
